# AI Mood Tracker Bot
# ðŸ§© Problem Statement:
# You're building a simple AI-based Mood Tracker Bot that simulates asking a user how they feel throughout the day (e.g., every few hours). 
# The bot analyzes responses using basic keywords (not real NLP) and updates mood statistics.
# You'll use:
# Local scope for processing each mood input.
# Global scope for keeping track of mood stats.
# Enclosing scope to organize internal logic.
