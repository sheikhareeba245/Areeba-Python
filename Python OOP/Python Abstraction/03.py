# Image Recognition System (AI-related)
# Abstract class: ImageProcessor
# Child classes: FaceDetector, ObjectRecognizer, TextScanner
# Abstract method: process_image(image_name)
# ðŸ”§ Task: Each class should override the method to print what kind of image processing it is doing. Simulate input by passing an image name like "image1.jpg".
# Abstract class: ImageProcessor
# Concrete child classes:
# FaceDetector
# ObjectRecognizer
# TextScanner
# Each class should override process_image(image_name)
# The user provides the image name and type of detection
# System prints what it's doing
