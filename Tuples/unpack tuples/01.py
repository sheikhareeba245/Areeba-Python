#when we create tuple we normally assign values to it this is pack tuple
#pack tuple
animals=("dog","cat","monkey")
#in python we also allowed to extract values back into variables this is called unpacking
(green,yellow,blue)=animals
print(green)
print(yellow)
print(blue)
#remember the number of variables must match number of values in the tuple it means that if there is three items in the tuple variables also has three variables
